#Why


With this project, I wanted to take a closer look at the process that can be used to design a full-stack MERN application.

Here I was able to apply many principles from the area of Redux among others. The flexibility of the separation between the front and backend was immediately noticeable.

#Basic Hosting Info 


The frontend is hosted on Netlify, while the backend is hosted on Heroku. The database was managed via MongoDB, as you can see in the stack.

Furthermore, of course, the repo can serve for further question clarification, or simply send a message to me.

Have fun with the project!
